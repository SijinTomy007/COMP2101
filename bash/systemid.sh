#!/bin/bash

#

# this script displays some host identification information for a simple Linux machine

# this version is specifically allowed to hardcode an interface name even though it is bad practice

#

# Sample output:

#   Hostname      : zubu

#   LAN Address   : 192.168.2.2

#   LAN Name      : net2-linux

#   External IP   : 1.2.3.4

#   External Name : some.name.from.our.isp





# the LAN info uses a hardcoded interface name of "ens33"

#    - change eno1 to whatever interface you  have and want to gather info about

# Improve this script by including the default router address and name

# Improve this script by including the network name

# we use the hostname command to get our system Name
# the LAN name is looked up using the LAN address in case it is different from the system name

# finding external information relies on curl being installed and relies on live internet connection

# grep is used to filter ip command output so we don't have extra junk in our output

# stream editing with sed and awk are used to extract only the data we want displayed
